**Introduction**

• Urgent need for fast, reliable, and accessible pneumonia diagnosis, particularly in pediatric cases where early detection plays a critical role in saving lives.

• Manual interpretation of chest X-ray images is time-consuming and susceptible to human error, highlighting the importance of automated AI-driven diagnostic solutions.

• A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained in MATLAB to perform accurate pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images.

• Deployment of the trained model on an Artix-7 FPGA enables real-time hardware acceleration with low latency, improved energy efficiency, and suitability for practical healthcare environments.
